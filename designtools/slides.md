## Grid Systems

A __grid system__ is a set of measurements a graphic designer can use to align and size objects a webpage.

Note:
Although there are a few different styles of grid systems, there are no strict rules on what can or cannot be a grid. It's up to you. Any guides that help you shape the final design is okay.
